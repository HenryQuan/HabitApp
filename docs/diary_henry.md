More animations, specially cross fade two lables. Last night, I was thinking of adding percetange to past habits. 
When a new habit completes or fails, the app will push to the list and add the new habit which its percentage and corresponding colour (green or red). Also, I will extract `Completed` widget so that it also supports `Failed`. Then, it is time to do past habit list. The `Intro` and `Turorial` page shouldn't be that hard. Maybe I can finish this app in a month if I work on everyday but who knows? I should do more design and know what kind of features I want.

Animations were added today. After the timer reaches zero, a new screen will popup and the check icon will be shown, followed by the text. This is a simple app so the animation needs to be great and it will be the main focus of this app as well. It is about time to use more animations so that the app feels alive.

Today, I was mainly focused on the one minute timer. The animation is quite smooth and it supports dark mode as well. 
There aren't many screens and if possible, I want to make it as clean as possible. Pushing everything to the limit.

## WoWs Info
I want to take a break from WoWs Info. Charge or not, this is a hard question. 
I cannot offer my app for free anymore so let's wait and see. 

## Henry's Habit App
This app aims to help you start a new habit. Only one and just one at a time. 
You just need to do it everyday for at least one minute. It will be 1 USD I think. 
I want to use make app to help me and also help others. 
It is not about how long you do it today or tomorrow. 
It is about whether you can keep doing it unless a point where you feel strange if you don't do it.
